# Sed-Subset-Implementation

INTRODUCTION:
In this task, we implement Speed.
A subset of the important Unix/Linux tool Sed.
You will do this in Perl hence the name Speed
Sed is a very complex program which has many commands.
You will implement only a few of the most important commands.
You will also be given a number of simplifying assumptions, which make your task easier.
This subset is a POSIX-compatible subset of sed with extended regular expressions (EREs).

REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION:
Many aspects of this task are not fully specified in this document; instead, you must match the behaviour of the reference implementation: 2041 speed. Provision of a
reference implementation is a common method to provide or define an operational specification, and it's something you will likely need to do in the future. Discovering and
matching the reference implementation's behaviour is deliberately part of the assignment, and will take some thought.
